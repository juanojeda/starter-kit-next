# Writing in Typescript

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We are building a starter kit for startups, with the assumption that we will be building web-based solutions
- Javascript is the standard language for the web, but it doesn't provide type safety
- Typescript is a defacto standard for modern web development as it compiles to modern javascript, but provides type safety

## Decision

We will write our code in Typescript

## Consequences

- We will have Type Safety in our code
- Engineers who don't know Typescript may need to brush up on this
