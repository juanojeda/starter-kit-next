# Add shadcn/ui as our Component Building Toolkit

## Status

proposed

## Context

- Building UI components is one of the more time consuming parts of building an application.
- We want to streamline this process so that engineers can spend more time solving the clients' business problems rather than in the technical details of a component.
- We have already decided that we will use Tailwind.
- Radix is a popular "headless UI" component library that provides a large number of components, free of styling, ready for us to consume and style as per the client's needs.
- Shadcn/UI is built on top of Radix, and provides a way to consume only the UI components that you want, rather than installing all of them. Additionally, it also puts the components within your own editable folder, so you are able to easily modify them for your own needs.

## Decision

We will use ShadCN as our component toolkit.

## Consequences

- Developers will be able to optionally install any of the components that ShadCN provides (listed [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/)) through the cli tool, as such: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add button`
- These components are not maintained by Shadcn. This is a pro and a con, in that our developers will be able to modify and adapt the components to suit our needs, however we will also not be able to consume any upstream bugfixes.
- Shadcn/ui is still quite a young project, so we may see major changes before it stabilises.
