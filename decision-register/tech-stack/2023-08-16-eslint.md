# ESLint for Code Linting

## Status
Accepted

## Context
- We want to ensure that we are not committing easily unavoidable bugs or syntax errors.
- We want to ensure a consistent style or approach to solving problems, wherever possible
- We want to ensure consistent HTML structure

## Decision
- We will use eslint to enforce consistency and lint our code.
- We will use configs from `next/core-web-vitals` and `@typescript-eslint/recommended` as a baseline set of rules
- We will maintain rules that warn on invalid DOM nesting in JSX contexts, to ensure valid HTML structure
- We will prevent pushing to the repo if eslint fails

## Consequences
- Our code will be linted against the agreed upon standards
- Code will not be able to be pushed to the repo if it fails
