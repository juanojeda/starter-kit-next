# tRPC for Type-safe API Endpoints and API Contracts

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We want to ensure that there is type safety and a guaranteed contract between the client and the server API.
- We want to minimise duplication of code, and easily share types across client and server
- We are designing within a Typescript codebase

## Decision

We will use tRPC for Type-safe API Endpoints and API Contracts

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Allows the sharing of API-specific type definitions between server and client
- Streamlines definition of API, as the contract and typing is generated as you define your methods
- Very easy to get typed code completion (in VSCode, and any Typescript-aware IDE) for your API methods
- Trivial batching of HTTP requests - reduces number of network requests
- Built-in methods for creating middleware (eg. routes with auth)
- Built-in support for Websockets/subscriptions
- Much easier learning curve than with the alternatives, as well as less boilerplate code.

### Drawbacks and/or dependencies

- The server and the API are necessarily coupled, as the server needs to provide a tRPC definition that the client can consume. This can be published in a different repo or location, but it must be defined using tRPC.
- Both the client and the server must be built using Typescript
- There is a smaller community than with the alternatives (such as GraphQL / OpenAPI).
