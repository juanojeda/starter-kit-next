# Using NextJS as our Web and App Framework

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We want to be able to deliver value to startups quickly
- We want to be able to offer full-stack solutions as well client-only or server-only solutions, where necessary
- We want to minimise learning new things, in favour of relying on expertise we already have
- There are many options in the ecosystem. Two front-runners that we have evalutated are Next.js, and Remix
- Many engineers at Everest have experience with Next.js
- Next.js has the larger community of the options we evaluated

## Decision

We will use Next.js as our web and app framework.

## Consequences

- We will be able to rely on the large community of NextJS users
- We will not need to (or be able to, depending on your appetite for learning) learn a new framework through this decision
