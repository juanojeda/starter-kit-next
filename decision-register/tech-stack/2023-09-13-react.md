# React as a UI library

## Status

Accepted
(Note: This ADR retroactively documents a decision made at the project's inception)

## Context

- In order to build a product for the web, we need to rely on a web-based UI library, in order to, for instance:
  - Build interactive components
  - Handle local state
  - Create visual elements
- There are many UI libraries in the market, however React holds a very large share of the market
- Most of the UI engineers at Everest have most experience with React

## Decision

We will use React as our UI library.

## Consequences

- Knowledge sharing within Everest will be easier, as it is written for a common library
- Finding solutions to problems will be easier, as React has a large active community
- It may provide some synergy with the React-Native starter kit for mobile development, if clients need both a native and a web solution
