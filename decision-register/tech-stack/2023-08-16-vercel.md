# Vercel as a Deployment Platform

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- We want to provide a way to deploy our code to our customers or market
- We want to be able to move quickly while we validate the product or market fit
- We have already decided to use Next.js as our Web/App framework

## Decision

- We will use Vercel as our Deployment platform within this starter kit
- We will make the integration with Vercel easy enough to reverse for when the client has outgrown the value, or needs to migrate to a more mature platform such as AWS or Azure.

## Consequences

- Deployment is low-effort and low-configuration (as compared to something more robust, like AWS or Azure)
- Provides out-of-the-box solutions for asset caching, image hosting/optimisation
- Our customers will need to pay for Vercel services
- When customers outgrow the market/product validation phase, it's very likely that they will want to move away from Vercel. In this instance, it will be up to the client or the engineering team to identify the needs and determine best fit.
- We will need to ensure that extracting Vercel is a trivial exercise
