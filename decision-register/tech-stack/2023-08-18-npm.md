# npm as the build tool

# Title

Use `npm` as the projects initial build tool

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As this project relies on the JS ecosystem, we need a defined mechanism to package, build, test, clean, deploy projects in a consistent manner.

There are a number of options in this space such as `yarn` and `pnpm`. However, following the principles of "Modern" but "Boring Technology", we'll stick with something the vast majority of people will be familiar with.

## Decision

We will use `npm` as the initial build tool of choice.

## Consequences

Projects that use this starter kit as a base will have to use `npm` even if the team may prefer using something (even-more) Modern such as `yarm` or `pnpm`.

There does not appear to be any constraint for teams using this starter kit to take on migrating to whatever package manager they wish; they'll just have to take on that effort.

In the future, if any of the other build/package tools become THE de facto standard (as `npm` had been), then it can be taken up as a future decision.
