# NextAuth for Authentication

## Status

Accepted

## Context

- Many startups need a solution for authenticating users
- We have decided to use Next.js for our Web/App framework

## Decision

We will use NextAuth as our Authentication library

## Consequences

- Development will be streamlined as NextAuth is built for Next.js
- Reduces development effort as it manages cookie life cycle and ensures best practices are followed, e.g http only header set etc
- Easy to develop authentication with many auth providers
- Has a large community with a lot of users
  - Pro: lots of answers to common questions, solutions to problems
  - Con: because many apps use it, it could be a larger target for security risks
- Obfuscates some authentication logic (adds some "magic") that may make things harder to understand. This is a tradeoff for having some decisions made for us / not having to manage authentication logic ourselves.
